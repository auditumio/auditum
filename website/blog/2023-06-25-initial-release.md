Welcome to the Auditum Blog!

We are pleased to announce the initial release of Auditum. Taking the first
steps, it already has a core set of features that will allow you to get started
with audit trail in your application. You can find more information about it in
the [documentation](/docs/intro).

The goal of Auditum is to advocate for greater adoption of audit trail in modern
applications. Regardless of the domain, we always found audit logs to be a 
very useful tool, but we also found that they are often overlooked or underused.
We hope that Auditum will help developers and organizations implement audit logs
and make better use of them.

Auditum is a free and open source project, and we welcome contributions from the
community. We would love to see you as an early adopter and hear your feedback
and suggestions, as it will help determine the direction of the project.

Thank you for your interest in Auditum! We hope you will find it useful.
